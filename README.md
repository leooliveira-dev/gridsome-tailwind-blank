# Default starter for Gridsome
Pretty much the default Gridsome template. The Hello World components don't exist, and TailwindCSS (along with PurgeCSS) is already set up. The rest is up to you!

## Why would I use this?
By default, every `gridsome create` clones a standard repo from Gridsome, with a bunch of files you won't need. To avoid having to scrap everything and set Tailwind up everytime, I created this project to speed up this starting process!

## How do I use this?
It's not as simple as cloning the repo. You have to pass it as an argument when creating a new Gridsome project. Open your terminal and run this:
`gridsome create your-project https://github.com/leooliveira-dev/gridsome-tailwind-blank`

## Will you update this?
Probably. By the time of this commit, I'm a begginer, not just on Gridsome, but web development in general. As soon as I figure out that there are other things this boilerplate should include, I will definitely do so!
